# Sleep-Calculator
This is a program that i coded in Python to give the 4 best bedtime choices; as that getting a good sleep at night is more than just going to bed early, it's about finding
the right time to wake up feeling fresh and relaxed every morning.

-By waking up in one of these times your sleep cycles will be 90-minutes long; knowing that a good night's sleep consists of 5-9 complete sleep cycles.

-Note that hours are in the 24 format!
